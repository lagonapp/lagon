# Lagon Alpha release

Lagon is an [open-source](https://github.com/lagonapp/lagon) runtime and platform that allows developers to run TypeScript and JavaScript Functions at the Edge, using V8 Isolates. Think of it as an open-source alternative to Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Fastly@Edge, and other similar platforms.

The runtime powering Lagon is written from scratch in Rust, using the V8 JavaScript engine.

## Lagon Cloud

Today, we're releasing the Alpha version of Lagon. The Cloud version is now accessible through a waitlist, where we will give access progressively. [Join the waitlist here!](https://tally.so/r/n9q1Rp)

You can deploy JavaScript and TypeScript Functions to Lagon Cloud in a few seconds using the [CLI](/cli), and run them at the Edge, in **14 regions**. That means you and your users always have low latency, anywhere in the world. Read the [Get started documentation](/get-started) to learn more.

## Lagon self-hosted

Lagon is fully [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/lagonapp/lagon), and already built with self-hosting in mind. Meanwhile, the documentation is still being written, along with easier deployment options. We'll be releasing more information about self-hosting in the coming months.

## What's next?

We're working on a lot of things, including:

- Integrations with popular frameworks and libraries, like Next.js, Remix, Nuxt.js, Astro...
- More examples and templates
- More regions for Lagon Cloud
- Easy deployments for Lagon self-hosted
- Improvements to the documentation
- And fixing bugs!

The easiest way to deploy and manage Functions is through our [Command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

## Installation

Lagon CLI is available for the following operating systems:

- macOS (Intel and M1)
- Linux (x64 and arm64)
- Windows (x64)

We recommend installing the CLI globally, using the package manager of your choice. You will also need [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) installed globally on your machine, as we use it to bundle your Function's code:

```bash
# NPM
npm install --global @lagon/cli esbuild
# Yarn
yarn global add @lagon/cli esbuild
# PNPM
pnpm install --global @lagon/cli esbuild
```

## Usage

Once installed, execute the `lagon` CLI to see all the commands available.

### `lagon login`

Before being able to deploy and manage Functions, you will need to log in. Make sure you have already [created an account](/cloud/account). If you try to execute a command that requires being logged in, you will be warned and the command will be aborted.

To proceed, run `lagon login` and follow the instructions.

### `lagon logout`

If you want, you can log out at any time. For security, you will be asked to confirm that you want to log out.

To proceed, run `lagon logout` and follow the instructions.

### `lagon deploy`

Create a new Function or a new Deployment in the given directory. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. If you are executing the command for the first time:

1. You will be prompted to select an Organization
2. You will be able to link to an existing Function, or create a new one by specifying a name

If you then want to trigger a new Deployment, re-run the same command. By default, subsequent Deployments are created in preview mode. Specify `--prod` to deploy in production mode.

This command accepts the following arguments and options:

- `[PATH]` is an optional path to a file or directory containing the Function. (Default: `.`)
- `--client, -c <CLIENT>` allows you to specify a path to an additional file to bundle as a client-side script.
- `--public, -p <<PUBLIC_DIR>>` allows you to specify a path to a directory containing assets to be served statically.
- `--production, --prod` allows you to deploy the Function in production mode. (Default: `false`)

Examples:

```bash
# Deploy the current directory to Production
lagon deploy --prod
# Deploy the index.ts file
lagon deploy ./index.ts
# Deploy the my-project directory and override the public directory
lagon deploy ./my-project --public ./my-project/assets
```

### `lagon ls`

List all the Deployments of the given directory. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accepts only one argument:

- `[DIRECTORY]` is an optional path to a directory containing the Function. (Default: `.`)

Example:

```bash
# List Deployments in the current directory
lagon ls
# List Deployments of the my-project directory
lagon ls ./my-project
```

### `lagon promote`

Promote the given Deployment to production. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accepts the following arguments:

- `<DEPLOYMENT_ID>` the ID of the Deployment to promote.
- `[DIRECTORY]` is an optional path to a directory containing the Function. (Default: `.`)

Example:

```bash
# Promote the cl...km Deployment in the current directory
lagon promote claxnlc230738q5pa7iximskm
# Promote the cl...km Deployment of the my-project directory
lagon promote claxnlc230738q5pa7iximskm ./my-project
```

### `lagon undeploy`

Un-deploy a Deployment. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accepts the following arguments:

- `<DEPLOYMENT_ID>` the ID of the Deployment to undeploy.
- `[DIRECTORY]` is an optional path to a directory containing the Function. (Default: `.`)

Example:

```bash
# Undeploy the cl...km Deployment in the current directory
lagon undeploy claxnlc230738q5pa7iximskm
# Undeploy the cl...km Deployment of the my-project directory
lagon undeploy claxnlc230738q5pa7iximskm ./my-project
```

### `lagon rm`

<Callout type="error">
  Deleting a Function also deletes permanently all of its Deployments, statistics and logs.
</Callout>

Delete completely a Function. You'll be asked to confirm before proceeding. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accepts only one argument:

- `[DIRECTORY]` is an optional path to a directory containing the Function. (Default: `.`)

Example:

```bash
# Delete the current directory's Function
lagon rm
# Delete the my-project directory's Function
lagon rm ./my-project
```

### `lagon dev`

Launch a local dev server, using the same Runtime as when deployed to the Cloud. You can either:

- Use this command without arguments, to use the current directory configuration
- Specify a path to a directory containing a Function and its configuration
- Specify a path to a file containing a Function

This command accepts the following arguments and options:

- `[PATH]` is an optional path to a directory or file containing the Function. (Default: `.`)
- `--client, -c <CLIENT>` allows you to specify a path to an additional file to bundle as a client-side script.
- `--public, -p <<PUBLIC_DIR>>` allows you to specify a path to a directory containing assets to be served statically.
- `--hostname <HOSTNAME>` allows you to specify a custom hostname to start the server on. (Default: `127.0.0.1`)
- `--port <PORT>` allows you to specify a custom port to start the server on. (Default: `1234`)
- `--env <FILE>` allows you to specify an environment file (typically `.env`) to use to inject environment variables.
- `--allow-code-generation` allows you to enable code generation from strings (`eval` / `new Function`)

<Callout type="warning">
  Although the `dev` command uses the same Runtime as when deployed, the local HTTP server itself doesn't have the same
  optimizations. As such, you shouldn't run a production environment on it, or run any kind of load tests/benchmarks.
</Callout>

Examples:

```bash
# Run a local dev server in the current directory
lagon dev
# Run a local dev server with a file entrypoint and some assets
lagon dev ./server.tsx --public ./assets
# Run a local dev server inside the my-project directory using a custom port
lagon dev ./my-project --port 56565
```

### `lagon build`

For debugging purposes, you can build a Function and see its output without deploying it. Under the hood, `lagon build` does the same steps as `lagon deploy`, but skips the deployment part and instead writes the output to a local `.lagon` folder.

This command accepts the following arguments and options:

- `[PATH]` is an optional path to a file or directory containing the Function. (Default: `.`)
- `--client, -c <CLIENT>` allows you to specify a path to an additional file to bundle as a client-side script.
- `--public, -p <<PUBLIC_DIR>>` allows you to specify a path to a directory containing assets to be served statically.

Examples:

```bash
lagon build ./server.tsx --client App.tsx --public ./assets
tree .lagon/
# .lagon/
#   index.js
#   App.js
#   assets/
```

### `lagon link`

Link a local Function to a deployed one, without triggering a new Deployment. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accepts only one argument:

- `[DIRECTORY]` is an optional path to a directory containing the Function. (Default: `.`)

Example:

```bash
lagon link ./index.ts
```

## Self-hosting configuration

If you are [self-hosting](/self-hosted/installation) Lagon, you will need to update the default site URL to the one used by your installation. To do so, find the configuration file located in `~/.lagon/config.json`:

```json
{
  "token": "**************",
  "site_url": "https://dash.lagon.app" // Replace this field
}
```

Replace the `site_url` field with the one configured during the installation. To verify if it's working correctly, log in to your installation using `lagon login`.

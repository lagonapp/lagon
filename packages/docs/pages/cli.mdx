The easiest way to deploy and manage Functions is through our [Command-line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

## Installation

Lagon CLI is available for the following operating systems:

- macOS (Intel and M1)
- Linux (x64 and arm64)
- Windows (x64)

We recommend to install the CLI globally, using the package manager of your choice. You will also need [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) installed globally on your machine, as we use it to bundle your Function's code:

```bash
# NPM
npm install --global @lagon/cli esbuild
# Yarn
yarn global add @lagon/cli esbuild
# PNPM
pnpm install --global @lagon/cli esbuild
```

## Usage

Once installed, execute the `lagon` CLI to see all the commands available.

### `lagon login`

Before being able to deploy and manage Functions, you will need to log in. Make sure you have already [created an account](/cloud/account). If you try to execute a command that requires being logged in, you will be warned and the command will be aborted.

To proceed, run `lagon login` and follow the instructions.

### `lagon logout`

If you want, you can log out at anytime. For security, you will be asked to confirm that you really want to log out.

To proceed, run `lagon logout` and follow the instructions.

### `lagon deploy`

Create a new Function or a new Deployment for the given files. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. If you are executing the command for the first time:

1. You will be prompted to select an Organization
2. You will be able to link to an existing Function, or create a new one by specifying a name

If you then want to trigger a new Deployment, re-run the same command. This command accept the following arguments and options:

- `<FILE>` is the only required argument. It should be the path to a file containing and exporting a Function.
- `--client, -c <CLIENT>` allows you to specify a path to an additional file to bundle as a client-side script.
- `--public, -p <FOLDER>` allows you to specify a path a custom assets directory, that will be served at the root (`/`) of the Function. (Default: `public`)
- `--production, --prod` allows you to deploy the Function in production mode. (Default: `false`)

Examples:

```bash
# Create a new Deployment in production mode
lagon deploy ./index.ts --prod
# Create a new Function with a client file and some assets
lagon deploy ./server.tsx --client App.tsx --public ./assets
```

### `lagon ls`

List all the Deployments of the given Function. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accept only one argument:

- `<FILE>` path to a file containing the Function to list deployments of.

Example:

```bash
lagon ls ./index.ts
```

### `lagon promote`

Promote the given Deployment to production. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accept the following arguments:

- `<FILE>` path to a file containing the Function to promote a Deployment from.
- `<DEPLOYMENT_ID>` the ID of the Deployment to prmote.

Example:

```bash
lagon promote ./index.ts claxnlc230738q5pa7iximskm
```

### `lagon undeploy`

Un-deploy a Deployment. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accept the following arguments:

- `<FILE>` path to a file containing the Function to undeploy a Deployment from.
- `<DEPLOYMENT_ID>` the ID of the Deployment to undeploy.

Example:

```bash
lagon undeploy ./index.ts claxnlc230738q5pa7iximskm
```

### `lagon rm`

<Callout type="error">
  Deleting a Function also deletes permanently all of its Deployments, statistics and logs.
</Callout>

Delete completely a Function. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accept only one argument:

- `<FILE>` path to a file containing the Function to undeploy.

Example:

```bash
lagon rm ./index.ts
```

### `lagon dev`

Launch a local dev server, using the same Runtime as when deployed to the Cloud.

This command accept the same arguments and options as `lagon deploy` and `lagon build`. It can also accept the following options:

- `--hostname <HOSTNAME>` allows you to specify a custom hostname the start the server on. (Default: `127.0.0.1`)
- `--port <PORT>` allows you to specify a custom port the start the server on. (Default: `1234`)
- `--env <FILE>` allows you to specify an environment file (typically `.env`) to use to inject environment variables.
- `--allow-code-generation` allows you to enable code generation from strings (`eval` / `new Function`)

<Callout type="warning">
  Although the `dev` command uses the exact same Runtime as when deployed, the local HTTP server itself doesn't have the
  same optimizations. As such, you shouldn't run a production environment on it, or run any kind of load
  tests/benchmarks.
</Callout>

Examples:

```bash
# Run a local dev server on port 56565
lagon dev ./index.ts --port 56565
# Run a local dev server with a client file and some assets
lagon dev ./server.tsx --client App.tsx --public ./assets
```

### `lagon build`

For debugging purposes, you can build a Function and see its output without deploying it. Under the hood, `lagon build` does the exact same steps as `lagon deploy`, but skip the deployment part and instead writes the output to a local `.lagon` folder.

This command accept the same arguments and options as `lagon deploy` and `lagon build`.

Examples:

```bash
lagon build ./server.tsx --client App.tsx --public ./assets
tree .lagon/
# .lagon/
#   | index.js
#   | App.js
#   | assets/
```

### `lagon link`

Link a local Function to a deployed one, without triggering a new Deployment. Make sure you are [logged in](#lagon-login) before proceeding. This command accept only one argument:

- `<FILE>` path to a file containing the Function to list deployments of.

Example:

```bash
lagon link ./index.ts
```

## Self-hosting configuration

If you are [self-hosting](/self-hosted/installation) Lagon, you will need to update the default site URL to the one used by your installation. To do so, find the configuration file located in `~/.lagon/config.json`:

```json
{
  "token": "**************",
  "site_url": "https://dash.lagon.app" // Replace this field
}
```

Replace the `site_url` field by the one configured during the installation. To verify if it's working correctly, login to your installation using `lagon login`.

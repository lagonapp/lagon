Lagon is currently deployed in 12 regions all around the world. We increase the number of regions regularly, and you can also [request a new Region here](https://tally.so/r/mDqAYN).

We use multiple hosting providers to prevent a single point of failure and provide resiliency in the case of an outage from one of our providers.

Users are automatically routed to the region that is geographically closest to them when they request a Function, using a mix of Anycast and GeoIP.

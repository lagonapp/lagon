We have several limits in place to ensure that our service is available to everyone. Some limits depend on the plan you're subscribed to, while others are the same for everyone.

You can contact us if you need to increase some limits.

An Organization name can be at least 3 and up to 64 characters long. An Organization description can be at most 256 characters long. An Organization can have at most 20 Functions.

Additionally, code generation from strings is disabled by default. In the future, you'll be able to enable it on a per-Function basis. That means running `eval` or `new Function` will throw an error.

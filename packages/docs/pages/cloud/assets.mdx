Lagon can host and serve assets such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. These assets are static files that are not generated dynamically by your Function.

When deploying a Function, you can specify an assets directory using the [`--public` or `-p`](/cli#lagon-deploy) flag. This directory will be served by Lagon at the root of your Function's URL.

## Automatic assets serving

Let's say you have a Function inside an `index.ts` file, with a favicon and an image:

```
index.ts
public/
  favicon.ico
  images/
    image.png
```

To deploy this Function with these asets, you can use the `-p` or `--public` flag:

```bash
lagon deploy ./index.ts --public public
# Same as
lagon deploy ./index.ts -p public
```

Your Function is now deployed to `example.lagon.dev`. You can access the favicon and the image at the following URLs:

- `example.lagon.dev/favicon.ico`
- `example.lagon.dev/images/image.png`

In your HTML, you can reference these files using relative paths:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
<!-- ... -->
<img src="/images/image.png" />
```

## Limits

The number and size of assets are limited to prevent abuses. [Learn more about the assets limits](/cloud/limits).

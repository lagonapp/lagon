Static files are automatically served by Lagon, without additional logic or configuration needed.

When deploying a Function, you can add static files using the [`--public` or `-p`](/cli#lagon-deploy) flag. It accepts a path to a directory, which will be then served by Lagon at the root of your Function's URL.

## Automatic static files serving

Let's say you have a Function inside an `index.ts` file, with a favicon and an image:

```
index.ts
public/
  favicon.ico
  images/image.png
```

To deploy this Function with these static files, you can use the `-p` or `--public` flag:

```bash
lagon deploy ./index.ts -p public
```

Your Function is now deployed to `example.lagon.dev`. You can access the favicon and the image at the following URLs:

- `example.lagon.dev/favicon.ico`
- `example.lagon.dev/images/image.png`

In your HTML, you can reference these files using relative paths:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
<!-- ... -->
<img src="/images/image.png" />
```

## Optimizations

All static files are automatically compressed with [Gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip). A `Cache-Control` header is automatically set to `max-age=604800` (7 days) to enable caching by browsers.

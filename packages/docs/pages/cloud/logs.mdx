You can use the [`console` API](/runtime-apis#console) to log messages, objects, errors, warnings, debug information and more.

Four levels of logs are accepted:

- `debug` (`console.debug('Hello')`)
- `info` (`console.info('Hello')`, `console.log('Hello')`)
- `warn` (`console.warn('Hello')`)
- `error` (`console.error('Hello')`)

## When developing

Using [`lagon dev`](/cli#lagon-dev), logs are displayed in the terminal.

## When deployed

When deployed, logs are displayed in the Logs tab of your Functions. Here, you can filter the logs by the levels described above, and by the date at which they were logged.

The logs list refreshes automatically every five seconds.

## Limits

Logs are stored for 7 days.

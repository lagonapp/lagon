Instead of providing an HTTP endpoint, you can create a [Cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to automatically execute your Function at the given intervals.

## How it works

Cron Functions work the same as normal Functions, except that:

- Function's `Request` is always empty, meaning the body, URL, and headers are empty
- If the Function's `Response` returns a `200` status code, Lagon will log a success message, optionally logging the `body` if it isn't empty.
- If the Function's `Response` returns a non-`200` status code, Lagon will log an error message optionally logging the `body` if it isn't empty, and retry the execution later.

Additionally, Cron Functions aren't accessible via HTTP, either using the default URL or a custom domain. As such, only the production deployment is triggered by your Cron expression.

## Configuration

Head over to the settings tab of your Function in the [Dashboard](https://dash.lagon.app) and scroll to the Cron section. Here, you can configure the Cron expression, which will be empty by default. We recommend using a tool like [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) to generate Cron expression:

In the above example, Lagon will execute your Function every day at midnight (`0 12 * * *`). You can then click "Update" and your Function will be automatically executed at the given intervals.

Cron Functions only run in a single [region](/cloud/regions). You can select your preferred region:

## Disabling

To disable the Cron configuration, simply delete the expression and click "Update".

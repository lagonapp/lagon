By default, all Functions are assigned a unique URL, which is a subdomain of `lagon.dev`, pointing to the current production Deployment. The subdomain is always the name of the Function: if your Function is named `my-function`, your unique URL will be `my-function.lagon.dev`.

All domains (custom or default) are automatically assigned an SSL certificate, provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Adding a domain

You can add custom domains or subdomains to your Functions, pointing to the current production Deployment. Head over to the settings tab of your Function, and scroll to the "Domains" section. Here, you can see the default domain as explained above, and your custom domains.

To add a new custom domain or subdomain, write it inside the tags field and press "Enter" or "Space", and then click on "Update":

## Pointing your domain to Lagon

Now that you've added a custom domain or subdomain, you must update the DNS settings of your domain to point to Lagon. You can do this by adding a CNAME record, pointing to your Function's default domain.

### For a domain

<Callout type="warning">
  Apex domains (root domains) are not supported. You can instead redirect your apex domain to a `www` subdomain.
</Callout>

Let's say that you have the domain `my-domain.com`, and you want to point it to your Function named `my-function`. You'll first need to redirect your apex domain to a new `www` subdomain.

Then, use the following CNAME record to point your `www` subdomain to your Function:

```
www.my-domain.com.  60  IN  CNAME   my-function.lagon.dev
```

### For a subdomain

Let's say that you have the subdomain `hello.my-domain.com`, and you want to point it to your Function named `my-function`. Use the following CNAME record to point your subdomain to your Function:

```
hello.my-domain.com.  60  IN  CNAME   my-function.lagon.dev
```

## Removing a domain

To remove a custom domain or subdomain, click on the "X" button next to the domain name, and then click on "Update".

Lagon is an open-source runtime and platform that allows developers to run TypeScript and JavaScript Functions at the Edge, using V8 Isolates. It's also self-hostable.

<Callout type="warning">Lagon is still in heavy development. Do not use for production usages.</Callout>

Current status:

- **Dev**
- ~Alpha~
- ~Beta~
- ~General Availability~

## Features

- JavaScript Runtime written in Rust using V8 Isolates
- Native Web APIs like `Request`, `Response`...
- 100% open-source
- Deploy APIs, SSR(ed) websites, Webhooks endpoints, Cron jobs...
- CLI to manage Functions and develop locally
- Deploy at the Edge using the Cloud version, or self-host it

## Roadmap

The roadmap is accessible by anyone on GitHub. Feel free to open an issue to discuss about new features that you would like to see implemented.

## How it works

Lagon uses V8 Isolates, which are sandboxed environments used to run plain JavaScript. That means each Function's memory is isolated from each other, and that you can run a lot of them at the same time with very little resources. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [Deno](https://deno.land/) (and [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)), [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) are also using V8 Isolates to execute JavaScript.

Starting an Isolate is a lot faster than starting a whole Node.js process, which allows for almost free cold-starts.

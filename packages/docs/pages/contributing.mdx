### Documentation website

The documentation website is made of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files, located in `packages/docs/pages/`. It uses [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) behind the scenes.

If you want to preview your changes, you can run the documentation website locally. First, follow the [Requirements](#requirements), and then run `pnpm start:docs` at the root of the project. You can now access the documentation website on `localhost:3000`.

## Code contributions

### Coding guidelines

- Commits are following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention.
- We use ESLint and Prettier to format our code, which should be handled automatically by most editors. If this is not the case, you can run the `lint` script.
- Make sure to add a test when adding new features / fixing bugs, so we can prevent any other future bugs.

### Requirements

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16 and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) >= 7.3.0 (as of writing). You will also need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, and if you want to contribute to any Rust code, you will need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) >= 1.63 installed.

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install all NPM dependencies: `pnpm install`

And if you want to contribute to the Dashboard / Serverless:

3. Run the local docker-compose: `docker-compose up -d`

#### UI

The UI package is our design system. Navigate to `packages/ui` and run `pnpm dev` to start the Storybook on [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).

#### Dashboard

The first step is to copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You will need to fill in the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET= # Random secret
S3_REGION= # S3 credentials to a bucket you own
S3_BUCKET=
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= # Create a new GitHub OAuth app: https://github.com/settings/developers
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Then, navigate to `packages/dashboard` and run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` to generate the database tables. You can now start the dashboard using `pnpm dev`.

#### JS Runtime

#### Runtime / Serverless

#### CLI

### Before submitting a PR

We have some checks in place to ensure we don't introduce bugs or regressions in PRs. You can run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` at the project's root to ensure there are no lint and type errors.

Finally, run `pnpm changeset` to generate a [changeset file](https://github.com/changesets/changesets#how-do-we-do-that). Select the modified packages and choose the SemVer increment "major", "minor", or "patch".

> Lagon is an [open-source](https://github.com/lagonapp/lagon) runtime and platform that allows developers to run TypeScript and JavaScript Serverless Functions at the Edge, close to users. Think of it as an open-source alternative to Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Fastly@Edge, and other similar platforms.

## Announcing Lagon Alpha

Since our [last update](/blog/unveiling-the-new-website) on the new website, we've been working hard on Lagon Cloud: a platform that allows developers to deploy Serverless Functions to the Edge, close to your users.

We're excited to announce that we're ready to open Lagon Cloud to the world! You can now deploy TypeScript and JavaScript Functions in a Serverless-fashion, at the Edge in **+14 regions** (with more coming soon!).

With cold starts measured in milliseconds instead of seconds, and Functions deployed near users, you can typically expect **sub-50 milliseconds response times**. Plus, we've raised the CPU time limit, so you can run heavier workloads.

We've also worked on many [code examples](https://github.com/lagonapp/lagon/tree/main/examples) for popular use cases, libraries and frameworks (e.g Astro, Nuxt.js, Hono, Remix, vite-plugin-ssr...). [Read the documentation](https://docs.lagon.app/get-started) to learn more.

## How to get access to Lagon Cloud?

Make sure you've joined the [waitlist](https://tally.so/r/n9q1Rp), and then join our [Discord server](https://discord.lagon.dev) to request access to Lagon Cloud. We're limiting the number of users and we'll roll access progressively based on the feedback and stability of the platform.

## What's next?

We'll work on Lagon Self-hosted, add new features, improve stability and performance, and more. Your feedback is critical to help us improve the platform and the runtime.

Join our [Discord](https://discord.lagon.dev), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lagonapp) and keep an eye on our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/lagonapp/projects/1) to stay up to date!

Lagon is an [open-source](https://github.com/lagonapp/lagon) runtime and platform that allows developers to run TypeScript and JavaScript Serverless Functions at the Edge, close to users. Think of it as an open-source alternative to Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Fastly@Edge, and other similar platforms.

The runtime powering Lagon uses the V8 JavaScript engine (that is also used by Chromium, Node.js, Deno, ...) and is written in Rust.

## Lagon Cloud

Today, I'm very excited to announce the Alpha version of Lagon. We're giving access to Lagon Cloud progressively through the waitlist: [join it here!](https://tally.so/r/n9q1Rp) This Alpha version will allow us to fix bugs, gather feedback, and improve the platform.

You can deploy now TypeScript and JavaScript Functions to Lagon Cloud in a few seconds using the CLI, and run them at the Edge in **14 regions**. That means you and your users always get a fast, low-latency response, anywhere in the world. Read the [get started documentation](https://docs.lagon.app/get-started) to learn more.

## Lagon self-hosted

Lagon is [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/lagonapp/lagon), and is already built with self-hosting in mind. You'll soon be able to deploy the whole platform (the software embedding Lagon's runtime, and the web dashboard) to your own servers. We're still working on providing great and easy-to-use deployment options, so stay tuned for more information!

## What's next?

We're working on a lot of things, including:

- Integrations and examples with popular frameworks and libraries, like Next.js, Remix, Nuxt.js, Astro...
- Better DX (Developer Experience) of both the CLI and the Dashboard
- Self-hosting documentation
- More Lagon Cloud regions
- And fixing bugs!
